\section{Operations Initiated by PedelecStation}

\subsection{Boot Notification}

After start-up a PedelecStation, the PedelecStation sends a notification to the Central System with information about its configuration (e.g., manufacturer id, connected StationSlots and Pedelecs). CentralSystem will accept only registered Stations. 

After each reboot, the Boot Notification is sent.

The CentralSystems sends a response with the acceptable status, including current time and heartbeat interval if accepted.

The PedelecStation repeats the Boot Notification (in an appropriated interval) until the CentralSystem accepts the PedelecStation. The PedelecStation requests nothing else, until CentralSystem accepts it.

\subsection{PedelecStation Status Notification}

A PedelecStation sends a notification to the CentralSystem to inform the CentralSystem about its status or error condition within the PedelecStation including the connected StationSlots. A PedelecStation shall send a PedelecStationStatusNotification when it becomes unavailable as a result of an error condition or other external events.

\subsection{Pedelec Status Notification}

A PedelecStation sends a notification to the CentralSystem to inform the it about the status or error condition of connected Pedelecs. A Station shall send an PedelecStatusNotification when a Pedelec becomes unavailable as a result of an error condition or other external events.

\subsection{Authorize}

Before a user can choose and unlock a Pedelec with his CustomerCard (e.g., Bluecard), the PedelecStation needs to be able to authorize the operation. Only after authorization the Station will be able to unlock the Pedelec. For this purpose the PedelecStation needs user's Card-ID and PIN for authorization.

The response shall indicate, whether or not the Card-ID, PIN combination is accepted by the CentralSystem.

\subsection{Start Transaction}

When a PedelecStation unlocks a Pedelec and the PedelecStation notifies the removal of the Pedelec, the Station needs to inform the CentralSystem about this.

As response the CentralStation sends an acknowledgment.

\subsection{Stop Transaction}

After the Station recognizes the return of a Pedelec at a specific Slot, it needs to inform the Central Station about this.

As response the CentralStation sends an acknowledgment.

\subsection{Heartbeat}

To let the Central Station know that a Station is still connected, a Station sends a heartbeat after a configurable time interval.

The CentralStations sends a response with the current time of the Central System, which could be used to synchronize the time of the Station with the time of the CentralSystem.

\subsection{Charge State}

The PedelecStation informs the CentralStation at regular intervals about the charge state (in interval or if fully charged) of all connected Pedelecs of the PedelecStation.

The message contains the current timestamp, the meter values (Wh), the charge state (e.g., charging, completed), the PedelecID and StationSlotID.
