\section{Operations Initiated by PedelecStation}

\subsection{Boot Notification}

After start-up a Pedelec Station, the station sends a notification to the Central System with information about its configuration (e.g., manufacturer id, connected StationSlots and Pedelecs). Central System will accept only registered Stations. 

After each reboot, the Boot Notification is sent. 

The Central Systems responses if the Station is accepted, including current time and heartbeat interval if true.

The Stations repeats the Boot Notification (in an appropriated interval) until the Central System accepts the Station. The Station requests nothing else, until Central System accepts it.

\subsection{Station Status Notification}

A Station sends a notification to the Central System to inform the Central System about its status or error condition within the Station and the connected StationSlots. A Station shall send an StationStatusNotification when it becomes unavailable as a result of an error condition or other external events.

\subsection{Pedelec Status Notification}

A Station sends a notification to the Central System to inform the Central System about the status or error condition of connected Pedelecs. A Station shall send an PedelecStatusNotification when a Pedelec becomes unavailable as a result of an error condition or other external events.

\subsection{Authorize}

Before a user can choose and unlock a Pedelec (e.g, Bluecard), the Station needs to be able to authorize the operation. Only after authorization the Station will unlock the Pedelec. For this purpose the Station needs the Card-ID and PIN from the user for authorization.

The response shall indicate, whether or not the id, pin combination is accepted by the Central System.

\subsection{Start Transaction}

When a StationSlot unlocked a Pedelec and the Slot notifies the removal of the Pedelec by a user, the Station needs to inform the Central System about this.

The Central Station acknowledges.

\subsection{Stop Transaction}

After the Station recognizes the return of a Pedelec at a specific Slot, it needs to inform the Central Station about this.

\subsection{Heartbeat}

To let the Central Station know that a Station is still connected, a Station sends a heartbeat after a configurable time interval.

The Central Stations sends a response with the current time of the Central System, which could be used to synchronize the time of the Station with the time of the Central System.

\subsection{Charge State}
