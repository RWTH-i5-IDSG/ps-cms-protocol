\section{Operations Initiated by Pedelec Station}

\subsection{Boot Notification}

After start-up of a \acs{PS}, the \acs{PS} sends a notification to the \acs{CMS} with information about its configuration (e.g., manufacturer id, connected station slots and pedelecs). \acs{CMS} will accept only registered stations. 

After each reboot, the Boot Notification is sent.

The \acs{CMS} sends a response with the acceptable status, including current time and heartbeat interval if accepted.

The \acs{PS} repeats the Boot Notification (in an appropriated interval) until the \acs{CMS} accepts the \acs{PS}. The \acs{PS} requests nothing else, until \acs{CMS} accepts it.

\subsection{Station Status Notification}

A \acs{PS} sends a notification to the \acs{CMS} to inform the \acs{CMS} about its status or error condition within the \acs{PS} including the connected station slots. A \acs{PS} shall send a Station Status Notification when it becomes unavailable as a result of an error condition or other external events.

\subsection{Pedelec Status Notification}

A \acs{PS} sends a notification to the \acs{CMS} to inform the \acs{CMS} about the status or error condition of connected pedelecs. A \acs{PS} shall send an Pedelec Status Notification when a pedelec becomes unavailable as a result of an error condition or other external events.

\subsection{Authorize}

Before a user can choose and unlock a pedelec with his CustomerCard (e.g., Bluecard), the \acs{PS} needs to be able to authorize the operation. Only after authorization the \acs{PS} will be able to unlock the pedelec. For this purpose the \acs{PS} needs user's Card-ID and PIN for authorization.

The response shall indicate, whether or not the Card-ID and PIN combination is accepted by the \acs{CMS}.

\subsection{Start Transaction}

When the rental is authenticated, the station slot is unlocked and the user took the pedelec out of the slot, the \acs{PS} needs to inform the \acs{CMS} about this.

As response the \acs{CMS} sends an acknowledgment.

\subsection{Stop Transaction}

After the \acs{PS} recognizes the return of a pedelec at a station slot, it needs to inform the \acs{CMS} about this.

As response the \acs{CMS} sends an acknowledgment.

\subsection{Heartbeat}

To let the \acs{CMS} know that a station is still connected, a \acs{PS} sends heartbeats regularly in configurable time intervals.

The \acs{CMS} sends a response with the current time of the \acs{CMS}, which could be used to synchronize the time of the \acs{PS} with the time of the \acs{CMS}.

\subsection{Charge State}

The \acs{PS} informs the \acs{CMS} at regular intervals about the charge state (in time intervals or when fully charged) of all connected pedelecs of the \acs{PS}.

The message contains the current timestamp, the meter values (Wh), the charge state (e.g., charging, completed), the PedelecID and StationSlotID.
